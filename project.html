										<h1>Augmented Reality DRS</h1>

									<p>My project will be revolving around the decision review system used in cricket. Decision review system is basically a system, which when the on field umpires are unsure of a dismissal, they refer it to the third umpire, who then through the use of various software has a closer look at the dismissal, to ensure wether the batsmen is out or not.For my project I will be making a similar technology, with some added features which will be made using AR tools, which will allow them to be used through AR glasses, giving umpires real time feedback. At the completion of my project, i look to achieve something very similar to the picture above, the difference being it will be cricket related.</p>

									<h2>Motivation</h2>
									<p>The reason behind doing this project is that, being a cricket fan I hate it when players are given out unfairly, or they are not given out due to on field umpire causing a a blunder in their decision. There have been many instances in cricket where the umpires have given the batsmen out, but after depth analysis it is found that it wasn’t out, and the on field umpire made a bad decision, and due to the lack of referrals left for the team, they couldn’t use the DRS system. For example during a game between Sri Lanka and Australia, one of the Sri Lankan batsman was wrongful given out, after the ball had hit his hand rather than the bat, which led to his team losing a very important game by 96 runs. Another such blunder also occurred during a game between India and South Africa, where one of the South African batsmen had clearly edged the ball to a fielder in the Indian slip cordon, but the umpire refused to give it out. Also recently there has been issues regarding the availability of some of the technologies within, There have been many instances when such horrendous decisions have occurred, causing problems for teams. This is what I look to take out of this game through the Augmented reality DRS system, which will be used through AR glasses.

									<h2>Description</h2>
									<p>My project has various features, some which already exist and some that are new to the DRS system. DRS currently has 3 features, Hawk-eye (which is used to check wether the ball is pitching in line and hitting the stumps), snicko (which is used to check wether the ball has hit the bat) and Hotspot (It is an infra-red imaging system which is used to find inside edges in close LBW and caught behind calls). I will be using these features along with two new features, and I will be making these features available via AR glasses, which means I will be developing these features using augmented reality. The existing features will be the same, and the two new features will be impact and no ball tracker.</p>
									<p><strong>Impact: </strong>
										The impact feature clearly shows the umpires, where the ball exactly impacted when the team appeals for a caught behind or LBW. There have been several instances when the ball has impacted the bat first and then the pads, but the umpires has given it out as It is very hard to judge with the naked eye. This why this feature will prove to be very successful. The umpires through the AR glasses will be able to see where the ball impacted first if there are to be multiple impacts, and this will be real time, which means that they won’t be wasting anytime in going through the replays. So for example, if the bowler bowls the ball and the batsmen edges the ball onto their pads, the AR glasses as the ball nicks the bat will show ‘Impact bat’ and then underneath it will show ‘Impact pad’, and this will be in order, so it will make It easier for the umpires to make their decision. This feature will also help, umpires to check wether the ball has impacted the ground after a fielder has taken the catch, for example if the fielder takes a diving catch, and when he lands on the ground the ball touches the playing field, then the umpires will be notified that ‘Impact Ground’, which according to the rules of cricket is not out. </p>
									<p><strong>No Ball tracker:</strong>
										 The No ball tacker, is a feature which will follow the trajectory of the ball and predetermine wether it will be a no ball or not. In cricket if the ball Is bowled above waist height on the full, then It is given a no ball. Sometimes when the ball is very close to the waist, its hard to tell for the umpires wether the ball is a no ball or not. Therefore this new feature will judge the pace and angle of realise by the bowler, and judge wether or not the ball will be above waist height, is the software detects that ball will be above waist height, then the umpires will see a red sign on their AR glasses, and this way they can call the no ball a little earlier, allowing the batsmen to take advantage of the no ball.

									<h2>Tools/Skills required</h2>
									<p><strong>Tools/Technology required: </strong>As I am looking to develop a AR based DRS system, I will first need a software, where I can create the DRS system. Therefore I will be using AR toolkit, which is an open source library for creation of strong augmented reality applications, which overlays real world imagery. This software can be used with both IOS, Android and linux which is advantage.
									</p>
									<p><strong>Skills: </strong>Augmented reality development is very complex, which means I will need a lot of skills and knowledge about various things, such as programming. The programming language most useful for augmented reality development are Java programming language and C# programming language. Therefore to be able to develop this new technology, I am required to have high level experience in either of these languages. Along with programming I am also required to know about 3D mapping and object detection as well as image tracking of objects and images. These skills aren’t very feasible but they can be learnt and it isn’t hard to find resources to learn all the skills required for the development of this project.

									<h2>Outcome</h2>
									<p>The succession of this project would mean that the cricketing world has been revolutionised, this will be because on field umpires will have so many tools to help them make more precise decisions, and that to in real time, not using replays and going back and forth, to check the dismissal, which means that it is solving the original problem by removing errors from umpires decision, as well as saving time, as umpires have all the technology at their hands, they no longer need to refer to the third umpire. My project will just be the beginning of AR in cricket, I feel that this project will be developed even more as time goes on, and it will change the way umpiring is done in cricket, as well as reduce the amount of errors made, eventually bringing that error count to zero. </p>
