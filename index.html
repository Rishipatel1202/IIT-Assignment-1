											<h1>Hello, My name is Rishi<br />
											</h1>
											
										</header>
										<p>As mentioned above my name is Rishi, I from Melbourne and currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology (first year) at RMIT. Although I have lived In Australia most of my life, I was born in India, in the state of Gujarat which lies on the west side of India (top image on the left). I follow Hinduism as a culture not only because that’s what my family has been following but because I love the message it puts forward regarding the rights and wrong of life. With regards to my hobbies, I love playing cricket, cricket has been a part of life since when I was 4 years old. I am so passionate about cricket, that if I am not doing anything important, then i'll always have either a bat or ball in my hand, I probably play cricket 10 out of the 24 hours in a day, which really shows what cricket means for me. Another hobby of mine would be listening to Bollywood music, especially songs with meaningful lyrics.</p>

										<h2>Interest In IT</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>The two sectors of IT which i am really interested in would be Software development and cyber security.No one in my family comes from an IT background, so I actually never knew what programming, coding, software and things like that meant. That was until one day, I went to my friends house and I saw him making all the cool programs, via coding. That really attracted me and made me curious as to what exactly he was doing. After that he told me about coding and programming and all sorts of things, after which I started researching more about this field, which led to my interest growing in software development because that’s what my friend is doing, and also cyber security because I found it really cool on how we could using our device, control or monitor other peoples devices (not that I’m going to do that if I learn ethical hacking).</p>
										<p>Over the course of my studies in the bachelor of Information technology at RMIT, I would expect to develop knowledge about wide range of sectors within the IT industry, like AI, Cloud, robotics and others. This course provides me with leverage as it covers a wide range of topics which will help me decide which area other than software and cyber I can possibly approach and make a career out of. However the main thing I look to get out of this course would be programming knowledge and how to make a software or application from scratch. </p>
